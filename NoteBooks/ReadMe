In this approach, we perform four distinct tasks - Strength analysis, Node classification, Graph classification, and Motif analysis.

Strength Analysis: Incorporates Graph Energy and Algebraic Connectivity with a focus on triangular and hexagonal cycles.

Node Classification: Performed node classification on Zachary's Karate Club social network dataset. Employed the GCN model with additional features based on the count of triangular and hexagonal cycles for each node.

Graph Classification: Performed graph classification on the WICO dataset to predict if a graph is a conspiracy one or a non-conspiracy graph.

Motif analysis: Conducted a comparative analysis between cycles in the datasets utilized.
